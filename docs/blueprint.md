# **App Name**: VetAI

## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Displays key metrics like herd health, animal count, critical alerts, and activity levels. Includes visual charts for animal health status and a carousel of live camera feeds.
- Mastitis Detection: Analyzes animal behaviors (lying down, lameness) to detect early signs of mastitis and generates a risk score.
- Newborn Analysis: Analyzes newborn behaviors (nursing, mobility) in the first hours after birth to assess health status and survival risk.
- Regional Analysis and Map: Shows 'hotspots' of disease outbreaks and abnormal behaviors on a map, allowing users to report outbreaks in their region.
- AI Veterinary Assistant: An AI-powered chatbot where users can ask questions about animal health and care. The chatbot acts as a tool to decide if a human veterinarian would be more helpful and simulates initiating a live chat.
- Historical Records: Maintains a historical log of all alerts and events generated by the system.
- User Authentication: Firebase Authentication integration (with anonymous login) for managing user profiles and preferences.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light green (#A7D1AB), symbolizing health, growth, and nature, aligning with the agricultural and animal care context of the application.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0F4EF), offering a clean and soothing backdrop that doesn't distract from the data visualizations.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#94B49F), used for interactive elements and key information highlights, complementing the green palette with a touch of serenity and professionalism.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text, offering a balance of modernity and readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets, such as in the help center when displaying a command.
- Use clear, intuitive icons from ShadCN UI's component library to represent different animal health metrics and alerts.
- Dashboard layout should be clean and modular, using Tailwind CSS grid system for responsiveness. Prioritize key metrics and alerts at the top for immediate visibility.
